Data analysis, machine learning, and frontend deployment by Gokul Prasad.

Conducted as a preliminary crash course for [AI Camp](https://www.ai-camp.org/)

In order to launch the deployment:
1. Clone the repository 
2. CD into the repo's `app` folder
3. Run `python -m main` and select the localhost link that is generated. 

In `main.py`, line 29 details what link you would like to launch on. Currently, it runs on an AI Camp cocalc server but you can change it to whatever you would like.

The webpage deployment was based on the "Simple Sidebar" template through [Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template/simple-sidebar)
