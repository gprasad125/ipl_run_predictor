    - What are some key characteristics of the data?
	The data, sourced through publicly available datasets on Kaggle, contains multiple CSVs of varying information for the 2008-2021 IPL seasons. For our particular project, we are interested in three – the total batting & bowling cards for every single match, as well as total match summaries. We'll combine and pivot these to extract worthwhile features.
